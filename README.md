# InfoDash

The goal of this project is reduce the amount of time I spend on my phone by moving the weather and reddit to a webapp

The reddit portion of code was done following this tutorial:
https://github.com/UWCoffeeNCode/Past-Projects/tree/master/F19/Projects/CanadaU


Issues:
- lost the lastest version when my pc broke, so the combined version is not here, but the 2 side apps that were created first are here 


Current Goals:
    - recombine app
    - add the news
    - docker so only need to run 1 thing
